### Overview

In this project, the advertisement goal in Amazon website is set up using the data given by Amazon. The goal is to find the best terms that results in. more profits and sales and we need to distinguish the best and worst terms form this data frame.

We have two products named Quartz and JadeRoller which we need to analyse seperately.

The Primary goal is to find the best/worst terms and it can be developed to find other useful information from this raw data set.

The data is obtained by thr Campaigns that seller sets on Amazon for advertisement.

The Campaigns are divided to two parts:

Automatic Campaigns

In Automatic Campaign Amazon finds the terms that customers search in their platform and list them in each row. In Manual one, the seller finds his own favourite terms and ask Amazon to advertise for him.
